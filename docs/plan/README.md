# Planning

This directory contains implementation sequencing.

## Rules

- Plan docs are sequencing and review gates only.
- Plan docs must not define canonical behavior or interface contracts.
- When a plan doc mentions a contract or invariant, it must link to the owning doc under `docs/architecture/*` or `docs/specs/*`.

## Index

- [Milestones](milestones.md) - completed + planned work ledger
- [Backlog](backlog.md) - deferred v2+ items
- [Trace Lite runner notes](trace_lite.md) - what `trace-lite` does and does not do

See `AGENTS.md` (repo root) for milestone workflow rules.
