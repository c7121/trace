# ADR 0002: Infrastructure as Code Stack

## Status
- Accepted

## Decision
- Use **Terraform** as the primary IaC tool with remote state (S3 backend + DynamoDB lock), per-environment workspaces/state.

## Why
- Broad AWS support; team familiarity expected; easy policy-as-code (OPA/Sentinel) and plan/apply workflows.
- Fits Git-based review + CI/CD and drift detection.

## Consequences
- Standardize plan/apply via CI/CD with reviews; no manual changes.
- Provision required infra (orchestrator services, S3/KMS, Secrets Manager, VPC endpoints, CloudWatch).
- Manage state buckets/locks per environment.

## Open Questions
- None currently.
