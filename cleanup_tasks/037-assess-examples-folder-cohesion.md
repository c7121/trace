# Review Task 037: Examples folder cohesion

## Scope

- `docs/examples/README.md`
- `docs/examples/`

## Goal

Critically assess whether examples are cohesive, discoverable, and correctly separated from specs and architecture docs.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: do examples avoid defining behavior that should live in specs?
- Duplication: are we duplicating configuration snippets or flows already in specs?
- Organization: should examples be split into subcategories (Trace Lite, diagnostics, recipes)?
- Actionability: can a user run an example without hunting for prerequisites?

## Output

- A critique of current examples taxonomy and naming.
- Proposed reorganization within `docs/examples/` if it improves scanability.
- Any missing links from operator specs or deploy docs to the right examples.
