# Review Task 032: UDF specs

## Scope

- `docs/specs/udf.md`
- `docs/specs/udf_bundle_manifest.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether the UDF story is coherent and whether safety constraints are consistently documented.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: what belongs in UDF model vs bundle manifest contract?
- Duplication: are bundle fields described in multiple places?
- Safety: are trust boundaries, sandboxing assumptions, and resource limits explicitly stated?
- Compatibility: are versioning and validation rules clear?

## Output

- A critique of overlap and a proposed boundary between the two docs.
- A list of safety-critical statements that should be centralized.
- Recommendations to reduce narrative repetition while keeping constraints explicit.
