# Docs cleanup tasks

This folder contains selectable, bite-sized documentation cleanup tasks. Each task is a single Markdown file.

How to use:
- Pick one task file.
- Tell me which task to apply.
- I will implement only that task, keeping the diff focused.

Task list (recommended order):
- `cleanup_tasks/009-doc-hygiene-sweep.md`: Mechanical hygiene pass (no em dashes, Mermaid label punctuation checks, link validation).

Completed:
- `001-slim-docs-portal`: `docs/README.md` is now a portal; product overview moved to `README.md`; design principles moved to `docs/architecture/invariants.md`.
- `002-standardize-docs-entrypoint`: renamed the docs entrypoint to `docs/README.md` and updated references.
- `003-remove-standards-folder`: rehomed security and operations under `docs/architecture/`; folded doc ownership into `docs/architecture/README.md`; removed `docs/standards/`.
- `004-consolidate-query-service-docs`: trimmed `docs/architecture/containers/query_service.md` to be link-first; moved non-C4 details into specs and ops/monitoring docs.
- `005-consolidate-dispatcher-docs`: trimmed `docs/architecture/containers/dispatcher.md` to be link-first; moved credential minting contract to `docs/architecture/contracts.md`; linked lifecycle to `docs/architecture/task_lifecycle.md`.
- `006-merge-dag-configuration-docs`: made `docs/specs/dag_configuration.md` config-only and `docs/architecture/dag_deployment.md` deploy-only; removed overlap and linkified ownership.
- `007-consolidate-milestone-micro-specs`: folded milestone micro-spec content into `docs/plan/milestones.md`; removed obsolete micro specs from `docs/specs/`.
- `008-deploy-docs-reduction`: added `docs/deploy/README.md` entrypoint; moved Trace Lite local sync doc to `docs/examples/`; trimmed `docs/deploy/deployment_profiles.md` to be link-first.
