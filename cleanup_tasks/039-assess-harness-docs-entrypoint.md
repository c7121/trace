# Review Task 039: Harness docs entrypoint

## Scope

- `harness/README.md`
- `harness/NOTES.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether Trace Lite and verification flows are discoverable and not scattered between docs and harness notes.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: what belongs in harness docs vs docs/examples?
- Duplication: do harness notes duplicate docs/examples, or vice versa?
- Actionability: can a new reader follow the harness steps end-to-end without missing prerequisites?
- Drift risk: do docs describe behavior that differs from the current harness implementation?

## Output

- A critique of harness docs navigation and overlap with docs/examples.
- Recommendations to centralize "how to run" content in one place, with links elsewhere.
- A list of any broken links from docs into harness (or the reverse).
