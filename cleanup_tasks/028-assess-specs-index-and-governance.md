# Review Task 028: Specs index and templates

## Scope

- `docs/specs/README.md`
- `docs/specs/_mini_template.md`
- `docs/specs/_template.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether specs are organized in a way that makes behavior changes safe and easy to review.

## Assessment checklist

- Taxonomy: does the index reflect how humans search (JTBD and surfaces)?
- Ownership: does each spec own an explicit surface area and defer to contracts/invariants?
- Duplication: do multiple specs define the same behavior or the same schema snippets?
- Templates: do templates encourage the right level of detail and discourage drift?
- Navigation: can a new spec author find the right starting point quickly?

## Output

- A critique of the current index grouping.
- Proposed index changes (grouping, naming, or split) without changing spec content yet.
- Suggested template tweaks if they would reduce future duplication.
