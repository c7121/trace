# Review Task 029: DAG configuration spec

## Scope

- `docs/specs/dag_configuration.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether the DAG YAML surface is described as a stable contract and whether it cleanly separates schema from examples.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: does this doc clearly own the YAML schema and what is intentionally not supported?
- Structure: is schema definition separated from narrative and examples?
- Duplication: are concepts duplicated with operator docs or architecture docs?
- Consistency: do terms match `docs/architecture/README.md` core concepts?

## Output

- A critique of clarity and any ambiguous schema sections.
- A list of repeated concepts that should be linked instead of re-described.
- Recommendations to keep examples useful but non-canonical.
