# Review Task 034: Metadata and error contract specs

## Scope

- `docs/specs/metadata.md`
- `docs/specs/trace_core_error_contract.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether cross-cutting surfaces are documented once and referenced consistently across specs and architecture docs.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: do these docs clearly own stable surfaces?
- Duplication: are error semantics or metadata surfaces restated elsewhere?
- Structure: are these docs reference-first, with minimal narrative?
- Navigation: do they link to the specs/architecture docs that depend on them?

## Output

- A critique of duplication risk and recommended canonical references.
- A list of dependent docs that should link here instead of re-describing.
- Proposed structure improvements focused on scanability.
