# Review Task 022: Architecture index and core concepts

## Scope

- `docs/architecture/README.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether the architecture index is a strong entrypoint for implementers and whether it correctly points to canonical docs.

## Assessment checklist

- Core concepts: are the nouns minimal, defined once, and referenced consistently across docs?
- Reading order: is it the right order, and does it match what implementers actually need?
- Ownership: does the index clearly state where behavior vs schema vs contracts live?
- Duplication: is the index repeating content that should live in the linked docs?
- Coverage: are any key architecture areas missing from the index (or overly emphasized)?
- Link hygiene: do links land on stable anchors and the correct file paths?

## Output

- A critique of the index structure and any missing or redundant sections.
- A concrete "best next hop" recommendation for each core concept.
- A list of follow-up review tasks if the scope is too broad.
