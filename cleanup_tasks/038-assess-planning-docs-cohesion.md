# Review Task 038: Planning docs cohesion

## Scope

- `docs/plan/README.md`
- `docs/plan/milestones.md`
- `docs/plan/backlog.md`
- `docs/plan/trace_lite.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether planning docs serve a clear purpose without duplicating specs or architecture docs.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: what belongs in plan docs vs specs vs ADRs?
- Duplication: are milestones repeating spec content or outdated implementation details?
- Navigation: is there a single "start here for planning" page that routes correctly?
- Maintenance: what is the minimum information needed to keep these useful over time?

## Output

- A critique of planning docs structure and redundancy.
- Recommendations to shrink sections while preserving key intent.
- A proposed rule for what may and may not appear in plan docs.
