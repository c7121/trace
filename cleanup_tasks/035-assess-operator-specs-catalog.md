# Review Task 035: Operator specs catalog and recipes

## Scope

- `docs/specs/operators/README.md`
- `docs/specs/operators/`
- `docs/examples/` (recipes)

## Goal

Critically assess whether operator docs are reference-like and whether examples carry the narrative recipes without creating drift.

## Assessment checklist

- Ownership: operator docs own surfaces and invariants; examples own recipes and workflows.
- Duplication: are recipes or configuration snippets duplicated across operator docs and examples?
- Status clarity: does the catalog make implemented vs planned obvious?
- Link structure: can a reader move between spec, operator, and example in 1-2 clicks?

## Output

- A critique of the catalog structure and any missing cross-links.
- Recommendations to normalize operator doc structure (common headings, common tables).
- A list of places where examples should replace in-operator narrative.
