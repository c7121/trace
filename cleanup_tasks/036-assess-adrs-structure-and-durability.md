# Review Task 036: ADRs structure and durability

## Scope

- `docs/adr/README.md`
- `docs/adr/000*.md`

## Goal

Critically assess whether ADRs capture durable decisions without duplicating specs or architecture docs.

## Assessment checklist

- Durability: are decisions still relevant and not superseded by specs/contracts?
- Duplication: do ADRs contain large blocks of now-canonical content that should live elsewhere?
- Linkage: do ADRs link to the specs and contracts they impact?
- Structure: are ADRs short and decision-focused, not design docs?

## Output

- A critique of ADR relevance and any candidates for consolidation or slimming.
- A set of recommended cross-links from specs/architecture to the key ADRs.
- Any ADR taxonomy suggestions (if needed) for discoverability.
